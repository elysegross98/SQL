# SQL

#This repository contains SQL work from a project completed in the data analytics boot camp I completed. In this project, I analyzed how "Rockbuster Stealth LLC" (an imaginary movie renting company) could use its data to understand how to compete with services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. The goal of this project was to learn and master SQL. 

#In this project, I also utlilized my Tableau skills to present my results. Links to some of the Tableau visualizations I created follow:
